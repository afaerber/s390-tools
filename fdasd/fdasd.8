.SH NAME
fdasd \- partitioning tool.
.SH SYNOPSIS
interactive mode:
.br
     \fBfdasd\fR [-s] [-r] \fIdevice\fR
.br
command line mode:
.br
     \fBfdasd\fR [-s] [-r] {-a[-k|-l \fIvolser\fR]|-i|-p|-c \fIconf_file\fR} 
\fIdevice\fR
.br
help:
.br
     \fBfdasd\fR {-h|-v}
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfdasd\fR writes a partition table to a cdl (compatible disk layout) 
formatted DASD, in the form of
a VTOC (volume table of contents) for usage with Linux for S/390
or zSeries. If fdasd detects a valid \fBVOL1\fR volume label, it 
will use it, otherwise it asks to write a new one.
.br

\fBAttention\fR: Careless use of
\fBfdasd\fR can result in loss of data.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h\fR or \fB--help\fR
Print usage information, then exit.

.TP
\fB-v\fR or \fB--version\fR 
Print version information, then exit.

.TP
\fB-s\fR or \fB--silent\fR  
Suppress messages in non-interactive mode.

.TP
\fB-r\fR or \fB--verbose\fR  
Provide more verbose output.

.TP
\fB-a\fR or \fB--auto\fR  
Automatically create a partition using the entire disk in non-interactive 
mode.

.TP
\fB-k\fR or \fB--keep_volser\fR
Keeps the volume serial when writing the volume label. 
.br
This is useful, if the volume serial has been written before and should not
be overwritten. This option is only applicable in non-interactive mode.

.TP
\fB-l\fR \fIvolser\fR or \fB--label\fR \fIvolser\fR
Specify the volume serial.
.br
\fIvolser\fR is interpreted as ASCII string and is automatically converted to 
uppercase, padded with blanks and finally converted to EBCDIC to be written
to disk. This option is only applicable in non-interactive mode.
.br

Do not use the following reserved volume serial: SCRTCH, PRIVAT, MIGRAT, 
or Lnnnnn (L with five digit number); These are used as keywords by 
other operating systems (OS/390).
.br

A volume serial is 1 through 6 alphanumeric characters or one of the 
following special characters: $, #, @, %. All other characters are simply 
ignored. 
.br
Try to avoid using special characters in the volume serial. 
This may cause problems accessing a disk by volser. 
In case you really have to use special characters, make sure you are using 
quotes. In addition there is a special handling for the '$' sign. 
Please specify it using '\\$' if necessary.
.br

e.g. -l 'a@b\\$c#' to get A@B$C#
.br

Omitting this parameter causes fdasd to ask for it in case it is needed.
.br

.TP
\fB-c\fR \fIconf_file\fR or \fB--config\fR \fIconf_file\fR
This option enables you to create several partitions in non-interactive mode, 
controlled by the plain text configuration file \fIconf_file\fR.
.br

\fIconf_file\fR contains one line for each partition, using the following
 format:
.sp
[\fIx\fR,\fIy\fR]
.br

where \fIx\fR is the the first track and \fIy\fR is the last track of 
that partition.
Keyword \fIfirst\fR can be used to specify the first possible track 
and \fIlast\fR for the last possible track on disk.
.br

The following is an example of a config file to create three partitions 
using the entire disk:
.sp
[first,1000]
.br
[1001,2000]
.br
[2001,last]
.br

.TP
\fB-i\fR or \fB--volser\fR 
Print the volume serial, then exit.

.TP
\fB-p\fR or \fB--table\fR 
Print partition table, then exit. 
.br
In combination with the -s option fdasd will display a short version of the 
partition table.

.TP
\fIdevice\fR
This parameter specifies the device to be partitioned:
.sp
	\fB/dev/dasd/\fR\fIxxxx\fR\fB/device\fR
.br

where \fIxxxx\fR is the four-letter devno (device number).
.br

In case your are not using the device file system, please specify:
.sp
	\fB/dev/dasd\fR\fIx\fR
.br

where \fIx\fR is one or more lowercase letter(s) or any other device
node specification configured by udev for kernel 2.6 or higher.
