.SH NAME
lsreipl \- List the re-ipl configuration for Linux on System z

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlsreipl\fR [OPTION]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlsreipl\fR lists the re-ipl (and ipl) configuration for Linux on System z.

Using this tool you can see from which device your system will boot after you
issue the reboot command. Furthermore you can query the system for information
about the current boot device.

IPL (Initial Program Load) is the mainframe synonym for what is called
"boot" in Linux. Accordingly re-IPL can be translated to "reboot" in the non mainframe context.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-i\fR or \fB--ipl\fR

Print the IPL instead of the re-IPL configuration. This lists the configuration of the device
from which your present Linux installation was booted.

.TP
\fB-h\fR or \fB--help\fR
Print usage message and exit.

.TP
\fB-v\fR or \fB--version\fR
Print Version information and exit.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

This program is useful when executed within a z/VM or LPAR Linux environment and
can detect ccw as well as fcp based setups.
