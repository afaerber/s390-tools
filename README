Release History:
================
1.8.3
    Changes of existing tools:
     - zipl: Add support for device mapper devices.
         Allow installation of and booting from a boot record on logical
         devices, i.e. devices managed by device mapper (or similar products),
         e.g. multipath devices.

1.8.2
    Added new tools:
    - znetconf
    - cio_ignore

    Changes of existing tools:
    - dasdview: Add solid state device support.
         Extend the -c option to show if a disk is a solid state device or not.

    - lscss: Also show devices on the defunct subchannel.

    - all: Reworked s390-tools build process.

    Bug Fixes:
    - dumpconf: Validate DEVICE keyword, enhance error handling.
         The DEVICE keyword is accepted in both devno and bus-ID syntax.
         In case of invalid keywords the corresponding error messages are more
         precise.

    - zipl: Ensure that zipl is built with non-executable stack.
         The ".note.GNU-stack" section is lost when the boot loaders in zipl
         are built. The reason is that objcopy removes all sections except
         of the text section: $(OBJCOPY) -O binary --only-section=.text $< $@
         When the linker finds a object file without the .note.GNU-stack
         section, it forces the binary to have executable stack.
         To fix the problem, the noexecstack option is used in the link step.

    - zipl: "zipl --help" does not mention "--force".
         Add information on the "--force" option introduced together with
         "--mvdump".

    - zipl: Don't use "Error" if user answered zipl confirmation prompt with no
         For several operations zipl issues a confirmation prompt such as
         "Do you want to continue creating a dump partition (y/n)".
         If the user disagrees, there should be no error indication in the
         "Operation canceled by user." message.

    - zipl:
         * Exit when trying to run zipl on an unknown device type.
         * Skip check for invalid geometry on FBA devices.
         * Fix use after free error when installing a multi-volume dump.

    - vmur, ziomon tools: Install tools under "/usr/sbin" instead of "/sbin".
         Because vmur and ziomon use libstdc++ that normally is installed under
         "/usr/lib", we have to install the tools under "/usr/sbin".

    - cpuplugd: Fix cmm_pages allocation.
         Fix cmm_pages allocation outside min and max limitation.

    - dasdinfo:
         * Strip trailing spaces from volume serials with less then 6
           characters.
         * Read volume serials also from CMS formatted disks.

    - lsluns:
         Fixed disk encryption check that is performed when the new "--active"
         command line switch is used.

    - zfcpdbf:
         * Fix reading of recovery trace.
         * Fix tag checks in reading of hba trace.
         * Fix output of els requests in san trace.
         * Remove color output that only works on some terminal types.
         * Remove output of no longer existing driver flags.
         * Remove outdated code for support of 2.4.x kernels.

    - ipl_tools (lsshut):
         Fix printing of vmcmd shutdown action: Also print CP commands that
         have more than one word.

    - all:
         Fixed a lot of build warnings and minor bugs.

1.8.1
    Added new tools:
    - iucvterm

    Changes of existing tools:
    - dump tools: Add support for "Automatic IPL after dump"
         Kernels supporting the new shutdown action "dump_reipl" allow to
         specify a re-IPL device that should be used after dump. To
         exploit this feature the following tools have been updated:
         - zipl dump tools:
           Trigger IPL after dump, if specified.
         - zfcpdump:
           Trigger IPL after dump, if specified.
         - dumpconf:
           Allow to specify "dump_reipl" in case a kernel panic occurs.

    - DASD related tools: Add Large Volume Support for ECKD DASDs
         The DASD device driver with "Large Volume Support" allows to access
         ECKD DASD devices with more than 65520 cylinders. To exploit this
         feature the following tools have been updated:
         - dasdfmt
         - fdasd
         - dasdview
         - zipl
         - zipl dump tools

    - ziomon: Add report utilities
         New tools ziorep_config, ziorep_traffic and ziorep_utilization
         for performance data report generation are added.

    - vmur: Add "--convert" option
         With this option a VMDUMP file can be converted into the LKCD dump
         format while receiving it from the z/VM reader. LKCD dumps
         can be processed by the Linux dump analysis tools lcrash and crash.

    - lsluns: Add "--active" option
         With this option all activated LUNs are shown. In addition LUN
         encryption information is provided.

    - dasdview: Add "--characteristic" option
         With this option a list of hardware specific DASD characteristics is
         shown. Currently only the encryption status is shown, this may
         be extended for future releases.

    - tunedasd: Normalize profile data
         Change the scaling of DASD profile data from binary to decimal
         shifting. Also print the scaling factor.

    - qetharp, qethconf, osasnmpd and lsqeth:
         removed 2.4 supporting code

    - dasdfmt: Add "--norecordzero" option
         With this option the permission for the subsystem to format record
         zero is removed.

    - dasdfmt: Add "--percentage" option
         With this option one line for each formatted cylinder is printed
         showing the number of the cylinder and percentage of formatting
         process.

    Bug Fixes:
    - zipl dump tools:
         The 31-bit dump tools did not update the address portion of the
         disabled wait psw with the error code. This omission has been fixed.

    - zipl dump tools:
         FBA dump tool can only dump up to 4GB. When dumping a Linux system
         with more than 4GB on a FBA disk, a corrupt dump is generated, where
         the first 4GB of memory are repeatedly dumped. The problem is that
         the dumper code uses two 32 bit instructions, where 64 bit
         instructions are required. To fix the problem 64 bit instructions are
         used now.

    - Remove -s option from install sections in Makefiles
         Because the binaries have been stripped in the install step, the
         debug info was not available for rpmbuild. Therefore the -s option
         has been removed now.

    - Improve LSB (Linux Standard Base) compliance of init scripts

    - tape390_display:
         The command  "tape390_display <message1> <message2> <node>" can cause
         message "stack smashing detected" if <message2> contains exactly
         eight characters. This stack overwrite has been fixed.

    - lscss:
         Don't print newline for availability attributes containing blanks.

    - chccwdev:
         Suppress bash error message, if device is gone between test and
         read of online attribute. Exit with error if no device was found
         in a given range.

    - chccwdev, lscss, lstape:
         Add missing "-v" and "-V" (lstape) options.

    - chchp:
         Improve value checking.

    - dasdinfo:
         Fix handling of new sysfs layout. Due to changes in the sysfs
         dasdinfo did not find a block device to a given busid. Changed
         dasdinfo to accept the new and the old sysfs layout.

1.8.0
    Added new tools:
    - ipl_tools (lsreipl, chreipl, lsshut, chshut)
    - ziomon tools
    - lszcrypt
    - chzcrypt
    - lsluns

    Changes of existing tools:
    - zfcpdump_v2: Add support for memory holes
         zfcpdump was not prepared to deal with multiple, non-contiguous
         storage extents. This shortcoming has been fixed by introducing
         a new debugfs file zcore/memmap which contains information on
         start address and length of memory chunks.

    - zfcpdump_v2: Update to latest e2fsprogs (1.41.3) and kernel (2.6.27)
         versions.

    - zipl: Support for virtio devices
         This feature allows zipl to prepare virtio devices for ipl and dump.

    - zipl dump tools: Add multi volume support
         This feature adds the ability to dump on multiple ECKD DASD devices,
         which can be necessary, if the system memory size is larger than
         the size of a single DASD device.

    - lscss: Support for non I/O subchannels
         lscss now shows non I/O subchannels. New options to limit the output
         to ranges of subchannels or devices have been added.

    - lstape: Add SCSI tape support
         With this feature it is now possible to list installed SCSI tapes
         besides channel attached tapes.

    - ip_watcher: New qeth driver support
         Adapt ip_watcher to support sysfs interface of the qeth driver.
         This is necessary to support the new implementation of the qeth driver
         (kernel 2.6.26).

    - osasnmpd: New qeth driver support
         Adapt osasnmpd to new implementation of qeth driver (kernel 2.6.26),
         which does no longer offer the sysfs attribute notifier_register.
         Notification of added or removed OSA-cards now has to be done in
         user space (udev). The udev rule file '57-osasnmpd.rules' is
         provided now in the s390-tools package.

    - dbginfo.sh:
         Collect additional system information.

    Bug Fixes:
    - zipl dump tools:
         The tape dump tool provided incorrect input for the progress message.
         For memory sizes larger than 4G the progress message display stopped
         at 3584M thus leaving the user in doubt, whether the dump tool is
         still dumping or not.

    - zfcpdump_v2:
         With kernels 2.6.26 or above, the port_add attribute has been
         removed which caused "Dump to SCSI disk" to fail with following
         message:
            ERROR: Could not open /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<bus_id>/port_add
            No such file or directory 
         This has now been fixed.

    - lsdasd:
        - correct presentation of DASD HPAV alias devices 
        - improve performance of script
        - correct bug with non-privileged users
        - adaption to sysfs rules
        - improve usability

    - cpuplugd/mon_statd:
         Fix "Required Start/Stop" dependencies.

    - cpuplugd:
         A bug which prevented CPUs from being set online again after
         /etc/init.d/cpuplugd reload and restart has been fixed.

1.7.0:
    Changes of existing tools:
    - zipl: IPL-retry on IFCC.
         This feature causes the hardware to retry a CCW IPL operation on an
         alternate channel-path if an interface-control check is detected
         during execution of the CCW IPL operation.

    - zipl: Boot menu can be used to replace kernel parameter string
         zipl's boot menu for DASD devices has been changed to allow replacing
         the complete kernel parameter string with user input when the first
         character of user input is an equal sign ('=').

    - cpuplugd: Enhanced configuration file parser
         The parser of cpuplugd has been enhanced to provide more hints to
         the user at which entry in the configuration file a configuration
         error occurred.

    - dumpconf: Add VMCMD support
         The dumpconf init script now exploits the new "shutdown actions
         interface" introduced with vanilla Linux kernel 2.6.25. Up to
         five VM commands can be specified to be triggered in case of
         a kernel panic.

    - mon_fsstatd: Remove init script and sysconfig file
         mon_fsstatd init script and sysconfig file are replaced by
         mon_statd, which controls both monitor daemons mon_fsstatd and
         mon_procd.

    - lszfcp: Source code cleanup

1.6.3:
    Added new tool:
    - cpuplugd

    Changes of existing tools:
    - dasdinfo: New -x/--extended-uid option.
         With the PTF for APAR VM64273 installed, z/VM provides a unique
         identifier that allows to distinguish between virtual disks which
         are defined on the same real device. This identifier will be part
         of the UID. To allow for an easier upgrade, the original -u/--uid
         option will print the UID without this token and the
         -x/--extended-uid will return the full UID.

1.6.2:
    Added new tools:
    - vmur
    - lschp
    - chchp
    - zfcpdump_v2
    - mon_procd (with new mon_statd init script and sysconfig file)

    Changes of existing tools:
    - Use "-O3" compile option for all tools.
    - Update zipl to enable zfcpdump_v2.

1.6.0:
    Added new tools:
    - tape390_crypt
    - mon_fsstatd
    - dumpconf
    - dasdinfo
    - 59-dasd.rules

    Changes of existing tools:
    - DASD/Tape dump tools:
      SCLP console support to show dump progress on the operator console.

    - zgetdump:
      New -d option to check if DASD is a valid dump device.

    - No more XML in zfcpdump:
      Because XML is going to be obsolete, we now use the binary parameter
      block provided by the hardware to find out on which scsi disk the dump
      should be created.

    - dbginfo.sh:
      Collect additional system information.

    - No libsysfs in DASD tools:
      It turned out that using libsysfs is less stable than using the sysfs
      attributes directly. Therefore the libsysfs dependency has been removed.

    - Removed '-c' option of lsqeth.

    - Unification of 'invalid option' error messages, Makefiles and "-v" output
      for all tools.

1.5.2:
    Added new tools:
    - lszfcp
    - scsi_logging_level

1.5.0:
     Added new tool:
     - vmcp: tool for accessing the control program of z/VM using the
          kernel module 'vmcp'.

     - zfcpdbf: perl script to filter ZFCP debug (DBF) data.

     Added new features for existing tools:
     - vmconvert: 64bit support.
          Enhance vmconvert that it can convert the new 64bit format
          z/VM dumps in addition to the old format dumps.

     - osasnmpd: implement long options
          For for all options now also long options have been implemented
          using the "getopt_long" function.

     - dasdxxxx: DASD tool harmonization
          Some changes are applied to dasdfmt, fdasd and dasdview either to
          make the syntax more common to other Linux tools or to introduce
          small enhancements to get better usability.

     - zfcpdump: Update SCSI System Dumper
          Replaced the old Linux 2.4.19 kernel with Linux 2.6.12 and
          e2fsprogs version 1.32 with version 1.37.
          The busybox will be removed completely, since the functionality
          provided by busybox will be implemented manually.

     - dbginfo.sh: collect additional debug output.
          fixed collection of s390dbf files which moved to debugfs.
          Changed behavior when trying to detect the kernel version.

1.4.0:
     Added new tool:
     - zconf/lsqeth: shell script to list all QETH based networking devices

     Added new features for existing tools:
     - dbginfo.sh: collect additional debug output,
          corrected/changed command line handling

     - zipl: added --dry-run function
          This function can be used to simulate a zipl run without modifying
