#
# Exemplary configuration file for the cpuhotplug daemon for
# Linux on System z
#
# The file is evaluated by cpuplugd at startup when called with -c.
# It does not contain shell environment variables.

## Type:	integer
## Default:	2
#
# The minimum number of cpus. 
# This means in this example, that every time at least two cpus 
# will be available
#
CPU_MIN="2"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	2
#
# The maximum number of cpus to be enabled. If 0 is specified here,
# the maximum number of cpus equals to the number of cpus detected.
#
CPU_MAX="0"


## Type:	integer
## Default:	10
#
# The update interval described how often the current
# system state is changed against the configured set 
# of hotplug and hotunplug rules. The update intervall
# is defined in seconds.
#
UPDATE="10"


## Type:	integer
## Default:	0
#
# The minimum size of the static page pool
#
CMM_MIN="0"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	8192
#
# The maximum size of the static page pool (in pages)
#
CMM_MAX="8192"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	256
#
# The amount of pages the static page pool 
# is increased if a memplug rule is matched.
CMM_INC="256"


#
# Ruledefinitions
#
# Four kinds of rules are distinguished
#   (1) hotplug rules, used to enable cpus
#   (2) hotunplug rules, to disable cpus
#   (3) memplug rules, used to increase memory
#   (4) memunplug rules, used to decreade memory
#
# Within the hotplug/hotunplug rule definitions the following variables 
# can be used:
#   - loadavg:		the current loadaverage
#   - onumcpus:		the actual  number of cpus which are online
#   - runable_proc:	the current amount of runable processes
#   - idle:		the current idle percentage
#

## Type:	string
## Default:	"(loadavg > onumcpus + 0.75) & (idle < 10.0)"
#
HOTPLUG="(loadavg > onumcpus + 0.75) & (idle < 10.0)"

## Type:	string
## Default:	"(loadavg < onumcpus - 0.25) | (idle > 50)"
#
HOTUNPLUG="(loadavg < onumcpus - 0.25) | (idle > 50)"

#
# Memplug and memunplug can contain the following keywords:
#  - apcr:		the amount of page cache reads
#  - freemem:		the amount of free memory (in megabyte)
#  - swaprate:		the number of swapin and swapout operations
#
# Per default this function is disabled, because this rule has to be 
# adjusted by the admin for each production system, depending on the
# environment
#
## Type:	string
## Default:	"0"
#
MEMPLUG="0"

## Type:	string
## Default:	"0"
#
MEMUNPLUG="0"
