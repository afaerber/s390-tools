.SH DESCRIPTION
.B The vmur tool allows to read, create, list, purge, or order files on the
VM spool files queues (RDR, PUN, PRT). The following commands are supported:
.IP "     -"
receive: Read file from reader queue
.IP "     -"
punch: Create file on punch queue
.IP "     -"
print: Create file on print queue
.IP "     -"
list: List file(s) on spool file queue
.IP "     -"
purge: Purge file(s) on spool file queue
.IP "     -"
order: Order file on spool file queue
.IP "" 0
The vmur tool requires the vmcp kernel module as prerequisite.
For the receive, punch and print commands the vmur kernel module is also
required, and the corresponding VM virtual unit record devices
(in most cases 000c as reader, 000d as punch, and 000e as printer) 
must be set online (see chccwdev tool).

.PP
Minimum abbreviation: re
.PP
Use \fBreceive\fR when you want to read a file
from the VM reader queue.
The file to be read is identified by its spoolid,
a 4-digit decimal number.
Use the 'vmur list' command to display information
about files in the VM reader queue.
.SP
.SH receive options
.SP
The following command options are supported by \fBreceive\fR:
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-f or --force\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies that outfile is to be overwritten without displaying any
confirmation message.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-H or --hold\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies that the reader file to be received shall remain in the reader queue
after processing. If omitted, the reader file is purged.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-d or --device\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies the device node of the virtual reader device.
If omitted, /dev/vmrdr-0.0.000c is assumed.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-t or --text\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies that a text file requiring ebcdic-to-ascii conversion is to be 
received. Character sets IBM037 and ISO-8859-1 are used for the conversion.
An ascii line feed character (0x0a) is inserted for each 80-byte 80-byte
80-byte 80-byte 80-byte 80-byte 80-byte 80-byte input
record read from the VM reader. Trailing ebcdic blanks (0x40) in the
input records are stripped.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-b or --blocked\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies that the file is to be received using blocked mode.
As parameter for the -b option, the
hex codes of a separator byte and a padding byte have to be specified.
The parameter has the following format: 0xSS,0xPP
.br
All trailing padding bytes are
removed from the end of each record read from the virtual reader and
the separator byte is inserted afterwards.
The receive function's output can be piped to iconv using the appropriate
character sets, for example:
.IP "" 2
# vmur re 7 -b 0x25,0x40 -O | iconv -f EBCDIC-US -t ISO-8859-1 > file
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-c or --convert\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies to convert the VMDUMP spool file into a
format appropriate for further analysis with crash or lcrash.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-O or --stdout\fR
.IP "" 2

standard output.
.SP
.SH receive arguments
.SP
The following command arguments are supported by \fBreceive\fR:
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fBspoolid\fR
.IP "" 2
Denotes the spoolid, which identifies a VM spool file.
.br
spoolid is mandatory and must be a decimal number in the range 0-9999.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fBoutfile\fR
.IP "" 2
specifies the name of the output file to receive the
reader file's data.
.br
If both outfile and --stdout are omitted, name and type of the spool file
to be received
(see NAME and TYPE columns in 'vmur list' output)
are taken to build output file name name.type.
If the spool file to be received is an unnamed file, an error message
is issued.
.SP
.SH receive example
.SP
Receive the VM console of your Linux guest machine. In the 'vmur list' output
this is an unnamed file with identifier
CON in the right part of the CLASS column.
Assume its spoolid is 1234.

.br
      [-N name.type] [file]
.PP
Minimum abbreviation: pun/pr
.PP
Use \fBpunch/print\fR when you want to write a file to the VM punch or
printer queue.
Specify the --rdr option if you want the file to be transferred to the VM
reader queue.
.SP
.SH punch/print options
.SP
The following command options are supported by \fBpunch/print\fR:
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-f or --force\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies to automatically convert Linux input file name (or
<name>.<type> as specified with --name) to a valid spool
file name and type without any error message.
Invalid characters are replaced by _(underscore) and both <name> and <type>
are truncated to a length of maximal 8 characters.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-r or --rdr\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies that the punch or printer file
is to be transferred to a reader.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-d or --device\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies the device node of the virtual punch or printer device.
If omitted, /dev/vmpun-0.0.000d is assumed for punch,
and /dev/vmprt-0.0.000e for printer.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-t or --text\fR
.IP "" 2
specifies to
punch or print the input file as text file, that is perform ascii-to-ebcdic
conversion (using character sets ISO-8859-1 and IBM037)
and pad each input line with trailing blanks to fill up the unit
device record. The unit device record length is 80 for a punch and 132
for a printer. If an input line length exceeds 80 or 132 for punch
or print, respectively, an error message is issued.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-b or --blocked\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies that the file is to be written using blocked mode.
As parameter for the -b option, the
hex codes of a separator byte and a padding byte have to be specified.
The parameter has the following format: 0xSS,0xPP
.br
The separator byte identifies
the line end character of the file to punch or print. If a line has less
characters than the record length of the used unit record device, the
residual of the record is filled up with the specified padding byte.
If a line exceeds the record length, an error is printed.
.br
iconv output can be piped to punch or print, for example:
.IP "" 2
# iconv xyz -f ISO-8859-1 -t EBCDIC-US | vmur pun -b 0x25,0x40 -N abc
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-u or --user\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies the VM user ID to whose reader the data is to be
transferred. The --user operand must adhere to VM user naming conventions.
If a local user is specified (that is the --node option is omitted), the
user name is validated against the CP directory.
.br
The user option
is only valid, if the -r option has been specified.
If user is omitted, the data is transferred
to your own machine's reader.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-n or --node\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies the VM node ID of a remote VM system to which
the data is to be transferred. RSCS (Remote Spooling Communications
Subsystem) must be installed on the VM systems and
the specified node ID must be defined in the RSCS machine's configuration file.
The node option
is only valid, if the -u option has been specified.
If node is omitted, the data is transferred to the specified user
at your local VM system.
.SP
.IP "" 0
\fB-N or --name\fR
.IP "" 2
Specifies a name and, optionally, a type for the VM spool file to be created by
the punch or print function (see NAME and TYPE columns in 'vmur list' output).
.br
In the following situations the spool file type is ignored
and only a spool file name is set:
.IP "" 4
- if the string specified in --name does not contain any period delimiter.
.IP "" 4
- if the only period appears at the very first beginning of string.
.IP "" 4
- if a period appears at the very end of string and is not preceded by
another period.
.IP "" 2
If --name is omitted:
.IP "" 4
- The Linux input file name (if any) is taken instead
and an error message is issued, if it does not comply to VM file
name rules (e.g. longer than 8 chars).
.IP "" 4
- If the Linux input file name is also omitted (that is data is read
from standard input), then an error message is issued.
