.TH DUMPCONF 8 "Nov 2009" "s390-tools"

.SH NAME
dumpconf \- Configure an ON_PANIC action for Linux on System z.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
\fBdumpconf\fR [start|stop|status]
.br
\fBdumpconf\fR [-h|-v]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdumpconf\fR reads the /etc/sysconfig/dumpconf file
and establishes the action to be taken in case a kernel panic occurs.

The following keywords can be used in the dumpconf file:

.TP
\fB  - ON_PANIC:\fR
Shutdown action in case of a kernel panic. Possible values are 'dump', 'reipl', 'dump_reipl', 'stop' and 'vmcmd':
.br

dump: trigger dump according to the configuration in /etc/sysconfig/dumpconf.
.br

reipl: trigger re-IPL according to the configuration under /sys/firmware/reipl.
.br

dump_reipl: first trigger dump according to the configuration in
/etc/sysconfig/dumpconf, then trigger re-IPL according to the configuration
under /sys/firmware/reipl.
.br

stop: stop Linux and enter disabled wait (default).
.br

vmcmd: trigger CP command according to the 'VMCMD_X' configuration in
/etc/sysconfig/dumpconf.

.TP
\fB  - DUMP_TYPE:\fR
Type of dump device. Possible values are 'ccw' and 'fcp'.

.TP
\fB  - DEVICE:\fR
Device number of dump device.

.TP
\fB  - WWPN\fR
WWPN for SCSI dump device.

.TP
\fB  - LUN\fR
LUN for SCSI dump device.

.TP
\fB  - BOOTPROG:\fR
Boot program selector.

.TP
\fB  - BR_LBA:\fR
Boot record logical block address.

.TP
\fB  - VMCMD_1, VMCMD_2 ... VMCMD_5:\fR
Up to five CP commands, which are triggered in case of a kernel panic.

.TP
\fB - DELAY_MINUTES:\fR
Number of minutes the activation of dumpconf is to be delayed. If this keyword
is omitted, the default is zero, which means that
dumpconf activates immediately during system startup.
Specify a non-zero delay time only if you specified
shutdown action "reipl" or "dump_reipl".
These actions might cause a reboot loop
if the Linux kernel crashes persistently during (or shortly after) each reboot.

A non-zero delay time causes dumpconf to sleep in the background until the
delay time has expired. In this case messages are written to /var/log/messages.
By default (DELAY_MINUTES is omitted or zero) dumpconf runs in the foreground
and informational messages are written to sysout, while
error messages are written to syserr.

Example: If you specified DELAY_MINUTES=10 and
your Linux system crashes within 10 minutes after the reboot,
then dumpconf is not yet active and the default action (stop) is triggered.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBstart\fR
Enable configuration defined in /etc/sysconfig/dumpconf.

.TP
\fBstop\fR
Disable dump configuration.

.TP
\fBstatus\fR
Show current configuration.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h\fR or \fB--help\fR
Print usage information, then exit.

.TP
\fB-v\fR or \fB--version\fR
Print version information, then exit.
